## Flight Delays and Cancellations Analysis using Power BI
Here we provide a comprehensive Power BI dashboard project centered around analyzing flight delays and cancellations using the 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset retrieval process was automated through a Python script leveraging the Kaggle API to ensure real-time data updates.
## Data Preparation:
Collected the 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset from Kaggle,
Used a Python script to fetch and maintain the dataset in a designated folder
Cleaned the dataset using Power Query within Power BI.

## Data Modeling and Analysis:
Created a robust data model within Power BI to facilitate in-depth analysis.
Developed DAX measures to enhance data analysis capabilities.
Visualized data insights using advanced features of Power BI.

### Cancellation Analysis Dashboard:
Analyzed cancellation flights with a focus on cancellation percentages, reasons for cancellations, and trends over months.
Visualized data through charts depicting cancellation flights by airport and reasons.

### Delay Analysis Dashboard:
Explored average arrival and departure delays monthly.
Calculated average delay times for each airport and identified the top 5 airports with the highest departure delays.

### Airlines Analysis Dashboard:
Delved into airlines' departure and arrival delay times.
Number of diverted flights and how it is distributed over airlines.
Created a detailed breakdown of delay times for each airline.
